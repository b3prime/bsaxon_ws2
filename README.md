* **Name:**
* **GitHub Repository URL:**
* **Description of hardware (embedded hardware, laptop, etc):**

## Design 1: An Autonomous Vehicle

**(R1)**	**Discuss your approach to solving this design problem.**

**(R2)**	**Describe how each of your sensors and actuators will exchange information with the MCU.**

**(S1)**	**Create a flowchart to explain the sequence of tasks your MCU will handle in firmware.**

**(R3)**	**If you need extra parts, record those parts in the Design 1 tab of the BOM.**

## **Design 2: Help Hermione**

**(R4)**	**Discuss your approach to solving this design problem.**

**(R5)**	**Describe how each of your sensors and actuators will exchange information with the MCU.**

**(S2)**	**Create a flowchart to explain the sequence of tasks your MCU will handle in firmware.**

**(R6)**	**If you need extra parts, record those parts in the Design 2 tab of the BOM.**

## Short Answers

#### Timers and GPIO

**(R7)**	**What does it mean for a pin to be in a state of high impedance?**

**(R8)**	**How is a pin change interrupt different from input capture?**

**(R9)**	**When would you use one or the other?**

**(R10) What’s the difference between generating a PWM wave in PWM mode compared to one of the non-PWM modes?**

#### ADC

**(R11) List two methods of ADC and give a brief explanation of each. It can be methods explained in class or another method that you explore independently.**

**(R12) Why is ADC resolution important?**

**(R13) List 5 uses for ADC.**

#### Button Debouncing

**(S3)**	**Include the schematic as an image in the README.md file and a share link to the simulation in Circuit Lab.**

**(R14) How many components are in your circuit?**

**(R15) Why might (or might not) a company implement your circuit when shipping a product? Would it matter if the product is a children’s toy or a medical device? What about a wearable device?**
